          <p>You have come up with the most amazing idea and you have poured your heart and soul into making it the best it can be. Now it needs a website that can show all that talent and promise to the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>That&apos;s where I come in. At Big Pixel, I don&apos;t just want to take another default website and slap a logo on it. Instead, I want to take all that passion and promise that your business contains and show it in every pixel. This attention to detail also means you can dream big&hellip;</p>

          <p>Designing a brand is more than just a cool looking logo (though they do help).</p>
          <p>Done properly, branding should represent the essence of the company, person, or product. It should help provide a narrative that everyone understands. From gentle, soothing colour palettes to brash, bold, and aggressive shapes; all of these things can reinforce your message.</p>
          <p>Having spent many years designing brands for charities, international retail companies, and small startups; I have a wealth of experience in the field of brand identity. But not just the brandâ€¦</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Colour palettes</strong> &mdash; both online and offline, so you don&apos;t lose that important aesthetic moving from screen to paper</li>
            <li><strong>Brand guidelines</strong> &mdash; so other suppliers know what they can and cannot do with your brand. Allowing for a consistent message wherever you appear</li>
            <li><strong>Stationery</strong> &mdash; who doesn&apos;t love a well-made and thought through business card or letterhead. Those first impressions can count more than you think.</li>
