              <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹, I&apos;m Adrian Beston &mdash; the founder and Creative Director at Big Pixel, living under the vast skies of North Norfolk. I&apos;ve been a designer and web developer for more years than I care to admit, starting my career at PC World as an artworker before eventually leading their brand team. Since then, I&apos;ve worked with various SMEs, charities, and sole traders, building brand identities, websites, brochures, and more.</p>
              <p>I also founded the Milton Keynes Design Forum, which introduced me to a wide range of people from various creative industries and allowed me to work closely with the <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/">Design Council</a> (including an awkward encounter with Vivienne Westwood).</p>
              <p>These days, I specialise in building robust web apps using the latest technologies, with a particular focus on <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and React more broadly. As a Full-Stack Developer, I also handle the back-end systems that power the polished front ends, working fluently with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Fauna, as well as OAuth2 systems. I&apos;m experienced with a variety of content management systems, including WordPress, Storyblok, and my personal favourite, <a href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity</a>.</p>
              <p>Whatever the project, I take great pride in ensuring that the work I deliver is not only pixel (or point) perfect but also reflects the client&apos;s vision to its fullest. I achieve this by involving clients heavily during the initial scoping phase and keeping them informed throughout the project.</p>
